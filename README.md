## Time lines:

1) 11/16-17: Reading articles and make sure we have fullly understanding about those models
2) 11/18-20: Making sure done with real time video processing and small test set example,
11/20: Visit office hours to make sure we're on the track
3) 11/21-25: Make sure everytihng can run and make small two test cases individually.
